Embark on an epic journey through the realm of data jobs! This project zooms in on the intriguing world of data analysts, uncovering the highest-paying roles, the hottest skills, and the ultimate intersections of high demand and high salaries. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¸

Check out the SQL queries used for the analysis here: [sql queries](/project_sql/).


# Background
Fueled by a passion to decode the data analyst job market, this project was born. I aimed to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, making it a breeze for me to navigate the career quest of becoming a Data Analyst.

The treasure trove of data comes from an SQL Course by Luke Barousse, packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
To tackle this quest, I wielded a mighty arsenal:

- **SQL**: The backbone of the analysis, perfect for unearthing critical insights.

- **PostgreSQL**: The trusty database management system.

- **Visual Studio Code**: An exciting tool for database management and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub**: Ensuring the SQL scripts and analyses are shared and tracked for easy collaboration.

# The Analysis
 I wrote multiple queries each aiming to understand specific mysteries of the data analyst job market and answer questions I had. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs 
To pinpoint the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, specifically targeting remote jobs and jobs in Nigeria. This query showcases the lucrative opportunities in the field.

``` sql
SELECT

    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    (job_location = 'Anywhere' OR  
    job_location LIKE '%Nigeria')
ORDER BY 
    salary DESC
